# GTA Online Inside Track Horse Race Macro

Automatically bets in GTA Online horse betting minigame, where it is possible to get maximum payout with minimum bet in the Inside Track horse betting minigame. Assumes 1920x1080 fullscreen resolution by default. Can be configured for any resolution.


## Instructions:
1. Download the newest release https://github.com/tuokri/gtav-horse-macro/releases OR compile the script yourself.
2. Run the script (.exe).
3. Enter the horse track main screen (the one with the 'rules' button).
4. ONLY DO THIS STEP IF THE SCRIPT IS MISSING THE BUTTONS: Press alt+c to enter button record mode. MIDDLE-CLICK all the button locations in order to record their correct positions. You will get a pop-up message box showing you the coordinates after middle-clicking 5 times. **The correct order is: place bet button #1, horse button, increase bet arrow button, place bet button #2, bet again button.** That's 5 MIDDLE-CLICKS in total! You can left-click, right-click, smash the keyboard between the middle-clicks, as long as the middle-clicks are done on the correct button locations in the correct order. After the button locations are recorded, return to the main screen with the 'rules' button to proceed to the next step.
5. Press alt+a to start the script while in the main screen with the 'rules' button. If you recorded button locations, the script will now click those locations in order.
6. To end the script, press alt+b.


If the script still does not work right, stop the script (press alt+b or shut it down from the task bar) and repeat the above steps and this time correctly record the button locations.

Restarting the script resets the recorded button locations to default values.
